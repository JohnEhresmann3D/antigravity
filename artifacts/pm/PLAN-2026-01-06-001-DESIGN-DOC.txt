TASK PLAN
=========

Plan ID: PLAN-2026-01-06-001-DESIGN-DOC
Created: 2026-01-06
PM: Atlas PM Role
Related Spec: SPEC-2026-01-06-001-DESIGN
Status: Draft

---

OBJECTIVE
---------

Create comprehensive design documentation for Antigravity, a 2D platformer/Metroidvania
hybrid game for mobile and PC, establishing all core mechanics, visual direction, and
technical requirements needed to begin prototype development.


SUCCESS CRITERIA
----------------

1. All open design questions from spec are answered and documented
2. Game Design Document (GDD) exists with complete mechanics descriptions
3. Visual design direction document exists with references and mood board
4. Technical requirements document exists for mobile + PC deployment
5. Prototype scope is clearly defined (what's in/out for initial version)


CONSTRAINTS
-----------

- Maximum task size: small
- Time constraint: Design phase should complete before implementation begins
- Technical constraints: Must be feasible in Godot 4.5 for mobile + PC
- Scope constraint: Prototype-focused, not full game design


SCOPE
-----

IN SCOPE:
- Answering all open design questions
- Creating Game Design Document (GDD)
- Creating Visual Design Direction document
- Defining prototype scope
- Documenting technical requirements
- Creating reference/mood board materials

OUT OF SCOPE:
- Creating final game assets
- Writing actual game code
- Detailed level design (beyond prototype examples)
- Full narrative/story development
- Audio implementation details


TASK BREAKDOWN
--------------

Task 1: Answer Core Mechanics Questions
  Size: small
  Dependencies: None
  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Antigravity mechanic implementation is defined
    - Resource system is specified
    - Ability unlock progression is defined
  Verification:
    - All mechanics questions from spec have documented answers

Task 2: Define Mobile Control Scheme
  Size: small
  Dependencies: Task 1
  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Mobile control scheme is selected and documented
    - PC control mapping is defined
    - Controls support all core mechanics
  Verification:
    - Control scheme document exists with diagrams/mockups

Task 3: Define World Structure and Prototype Scope
  Size: small
  Dependencies: Task 1
  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Number of worlds for prototype is defined
    - World progression system is specified
    - Prototype feature list is complete (in/out scope)
  Verification:
    - Prototype scope document clearly lists included features

Task 4: Define Visual Direction and Tone
  Size: small
  Dependencies: None
  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Visual tone balance (Hollow Knight vs Mario) is decided
    - Color palette direction is defined
    - Art style guidelines exist
  Verification:
    - Visual direction document with references exists

Task 5: Create Game Design Document (GDD)
  Size: small
  Dependencies: Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4
  Acceptance Criteria:
    - GDD includes all core mechanics
    - GDD includes gameplay loop description
    - GDD includes progression system
    - GDD includes ability/powerup system
  Verification:
    - Complete GDD exists in artifacts/docs/

Task 6: Create Visual Design Document
  Size: small
  Dependencies: Task 4
  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Visual references collected (Hollow Knight, Mario)
    - Mood board created
    - Color palette defined
    - Art style guidelines documented
  Verification:
    - Visual design document with images/references exists

Task 7: Document Technical Requirements
  Size: small
  Dependencies: Tasks 1, 2, 3
  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Mobile platform requirements documented
    - PC platform requirements documented
    - Godot 4.5 specific considerations noted
    - Performance targets defined
  Verification:
    - Technical requirements document exists


NEXT TASK
---------

Task ID: Task 1 - Answer Core Mechanics Questions
Rationale: Must define core mechanics before other design work can proceed.
This requires user input on the remaining open questions.


ASSUMPTIONS
-----------

- User will provide answers to open questions in spec
- Design decisions will be made collaboratively (PM asks, user decides)
- Prototype scope will be intentionally small (1-2 worlds, core mechanics only)


RISKS
-----

- Design paralysis: Too many options could delay decisions
- Scope inflation: Metroidvania features could expand beyond prototype scope
- Technical feasibility: Some design ideas may be difficult to implement
- Mobile constraints: Control scheme may limit gameplay complexity


NOTES
-----

This plan focuses on documentation and design definition, not implementation.
All tasks are "small" to keep design work focused and iterative.

After this plan completes, a separate plan will be created for prototype
implementation following the Engineer workflow.
