  - Particles2D (effects)

Animation Player:
- Use AnimationPlayer for complex sequences
- AnimatedSprite2D for frame-based animations
- Blend both for best results

Sprite Flip:
- Use flip_h for horizontal flipping
- Rotate node for gravity flip (smooth transition)
- Scale for squash/stretch effects


NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Finalize character concept (user approval)
2. Create detailed sprite specifications
3. Design sprite sheet layout
4. Create placeholder sprites for prototype
5. Implement in Godot with basic animations
6. Test readability on mobile device
7. Iterate based on gameplay feel


ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTS
====================

If Concept 1 doesn't work:
- Concept 2 (Space Goober) offers more unique personality
- Concept 3 (Robo-Goof) provides mechanical charm
- Can mix elements from multiple concepts
- Can create variations on Concept 1 (different colors, details)


NOTES
=====

The 90s Saturday morning cartoon aesthetic is perfect for:
- Nostalgic appeal
- Bold, readable visuals
- Exaggerated animations
- Goofy personality

Cosmo the Clumsy Astronaut embodies these qualities while maintaining
a strong, recognizable silhouette perfect for a platformer character.

The design is intentionally simple to:
- Facilitate sprite creation
- Enable smooth animation
- Ensure mobile readability
- Support rapid prototyping

Character can be refined and detailed after prototype proves core mechanics.
