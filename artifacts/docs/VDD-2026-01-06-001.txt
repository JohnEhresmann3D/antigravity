VISUAL DESIGN OVERVIEW
======================

Antigravity's visual design blends two distinct aesthetics:
- Hollow Knight: Atmospheric, detailed, hand-drawn, moody
- Super Mario Bros: Readable, colorful, clear silhouettes, iconic

The game uses dynamic visual tone that shifts between zones, creating
variety and emotional contrast throughout the experience.


CORE VISUAL PRINCIPLES
=======================

1. MOBILE-FIRST READABILITY
   - Clear silhouettes that read on small screens
   - High contrast between player, enemies, and environment
   - Distinct visual language for interactive elements

2. ATMOSPHERIC DEPTH
   - Layered backgrounds (parallax)
   - Lighting and shadow for mood
   - Environmental storytelling through visuals

3. TONAL VARIETY
   - Bright zones vs. dark zones
   - Satirical upbeat vs. genuinely moody
   - Visual contrast creates memorable moments

4. MODULAR DESIGN
   - Reusable visual components
   - Consistent art style across zones
   - Tileable assets for efficient level building


VISUAL TONE BY ZONE TYPE
=========================

UPBEAT ZONES (Satirical)
------------------------

Mood: Bright, colorful, almost too cheerful (with an edge)
Inspiration: Super Mario Bros, but with satirical undertones

Visual Characteristics:
- Vibrant, saturated colors
- Clear blue skies or bright backgrounds
- Geometric, clean shapes
- Smooth, rounded forms
- High contrast lighting

Color Palette Direction:
- Primary: Bright blues, greens, yellows
- Accents: Pinks, oranges, purples
- Shadows: Soft, not harsh
- Overall: Cheerful but slightly "off" (satirical edge)

Environmental Elements:
- Floating platforms
- Bright collectibles
- Friendly-looking (but not necessarily friendly) enemies
- Clear visual hierarchy

Satirical Edge:
- Slightly exaggerated proportions
- Unexpected color combinations
- Environmental details that hint at darker themes
- Contrast with gameplay difficulty


DARK/MOODY ZONES
-----------------

Mood: Atmospheric, mysterious, slightly ominous
Inspiration: Hollow Knight

Visual Characteristics:
- Desaturated or limited color palette
- Deep shadows and dramatic lighting
- Organic, hand-drawn feel
- Intricate environmental details
- Atmospheric effects (fog, particles, etc.)

Color Palette Direction:
- Primary: Deep blues, purples, grays
- Accents: Glowing elements (cyan, white, pale yellow)
- Shadows: Deep, rich blacks
- Overall: Moody but not oppressive

Environmental Elements:
- Cavernous spaces
- Mysterious architecture
- Glowing crystals or energy sources
- Detailed background elements
- Atmospheric lighting


TRANSITION ZONES
-----------------

Purpose: Bridge between upbeat and dark zones
Visual: Gradual shift in tone, color, and lighting
Creates: Sense of journey and progression


CHARACTER DESIGN
================

PLAYER CHARACTER
----------------

Design Requirements:
- Clear silhouette (readable at small sizes)

- Works in both bright and dark zones

Visual Considerations:
- Contrasting colors (stands out in any zone)
- Glowing elements or highlights for visibility
- Expressive animations
- Clear visual feedback for abilities

Design Direction: TBD
- Needs concept sketches
- Should reflect "antigravity" theme
- Mobile-friendly proportions


ENEMIES
-------

Design Requirements:

PROTOTYPE ART APPROACH
======================

For the prototype, we will use:

1. PLACEHOLDER ART
   - Simple geometric shapes
   - Solid colors from palette
   - Clear visual distinction between elements

2. FOCUS AREAS
   - Player character (basic sprite)
   - Core platforms and hazards
   - UI elements (functional, not polished)
   - Basic enemy sprites

3. DEFER TO POST-PROTOTYPE
   - Detailed backgrounds
   - Polished animations
   - Particle effects (beyond basic)
   - Environmental details


NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Create mood board with reference images
2. Design player character concept
3. Define exact color palettes (hex codes)
4. Create UI mockups for mobile
5. Design first boss concept
6. Create sprite size guidelines
7. Define animation frame counts


NOTES
=====

The visual design should support the modular gameplay approach:
- Visual feedback for all gravity states
- Clear communication of game mechanics
- Scalable complexity (simple for prototype, detailed for full game)
- Mobile-first but not mobile-limited

Visual tone variety is a key differentiator:
- Creates emotional journey through gameplay
- Satirical upbeat zones add personality
- Dark zones provide atmospheric contrast
- Both styles should feel cohesive within the game's identity
