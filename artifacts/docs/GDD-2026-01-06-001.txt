GAME OVERVIEW
=============

Title: Antigravity
Genre: 2D Platformer / Metroidvania Hybrid
Platforms: Mobile (Primary), PC (Secondary)
Scope: Prototype
Engine: Godot 4.5

Concept:
A 2D platformer/Metroidvania where players navigate worlds using antigravity
mechanics. Inspired by Super Mario Bros (platforming precision) and Hollow Knight
(atmospheric exploration), the game features world selection, progressive difficulty,
and an ability unlock system tied to boss defeats.


CORE PILLARS
============

1. Gravity Manipulation - Core mechanic that defines gameplay
2. Exploration & Discovery - Metroidvania-style backtracking with new abilities
3. Progressive Challenge - Difficulty increases over time
4. Ability Mastery - Unlock and master new powers through boss defeats


CORE MECHANICS
==============

ANTIGRAVITY SYSTEM
------------------

The game features a modular gravity system with multiple components:

1. GRAVITY FLIP (Unlockable)
   - Unlocked after first boss fight
   - Allows player to flip gravity (walk on ceiling)
   - Toggle mechanic (press to flip, press to flip back)
   - Opens up new areas and platforming challenges

2. DIRECTIONAL GRAVITY CONTROL
   - Player can control gravity direction
   - Implementation: TBD (4-way directional, analog control, etc.)
   - Allows for complex platforming puzzles

3. ZERO-GRAVITY ZONES
   - Specific areas with no gravity
   - Player floats and must navigate differently
   - Creates unique platforming challenges

4. GRAVITY STRENGTH (Experimental/Debug)
   - Toggleable gravity strength for experimentation
   - NOT planned for different zones (uniform gravity per zone type)
   - May be used for testing/balancing

Design Philosophy:
- Modular approach allows mixing and matching gravity mechanics
- Each mechanic can be enabled/disabled independently
- Supports iterative testing and balancing


RESOURCE SYSTEM
---------------

Single Resource Type:
- Name: TBD (e.g., "Gravity Cores", "Anti-Matter", "Energy")
- Purpose: Powers ability usage
- Visual: Should be clear and readable on mobile

Resource Acquisition (Hybrid Approach):
- Primary: Breakable objects (boxes/chests like Mario)
- Secondary: Random drops from enemies
- Design Note: Exact balance TBD during prototyping

Resource Properties:
- Consumable (used when activating abilities)
- Collectible (found in world)
- May have maximum capacity (TBD)


ABILITY SYSTEM
--------------

Two Types of Abilities:

1. PERMANENT UNLOCKABLE ABILITIES
   - Unlocked by defeating bosses
   - Require resource to use
   - Examples:
     * Gravity Flip (Boss 1)
     * [Additional abilities TBD]
   - Enable Metroidvania-style progression (backtrack with new abilities)

2. LIMITED-TIME POWERUPS
   - Temporary boosts
   - Found in world or dropped by enemies
   - Examples: Speed boost, invincibility, double jump, etc.
   - Duration-based (not resource-based)

Ability Unlock Progression:
- Boss defeats are the primary unlock mechanism
- Creates clear progression milestones
- Encourages exploration to find bosses


PROGRESSION SYSTEM
==================

WORLD STRUCTURE
---------------

Prototype Scope:
- 1 World (primary focus)
- Expand to 2 worlds if prototype is successful

World Selection:
- Player selects world from menu/hub
- Worlds are discrete levels (not fully interconnected)
- Each world has internal Metroidvania-style exploration

Difficulty Progression:
- Difficulty increases over time within a world
- Later areas require mastered abilities
- Boss fights as difficulty checkpoints


METROIDVANIA ELEMENTS
---------------------

Exploration:
- Interconnected areas within each world
- Backtracking enabled by new abilities
- Hidden areas and secrets

Gating:
- Abilities gate progression (can't reach area without gravity flip, etc.)
- Environmental obstacles require specific abilities
- Boss defeats unlock new areas


VISUAL DESIGN
=============

VISUAL TONE
-----------

Dynamic Tone by Zone:
- Some zones: Upbeat, bright, colorful (Mario-inspired)
- Other zones: Dark, moody, atmospheric (Hollow Knight-inspired)
- Upbeat zones have satirical edge (not purely cheerful)

Design Philosophy:
- Tone variety keeps gameplay fresh
- Contrast between zones creates memorable moments
- Satirical upbeat zones add personality

Art Style Balance:
- Hollow Knight influence: Detailed, atmospheric, hand-drawn feel
- Mario influence: Readable, clear silhouettes, vibrant colors
- Mobile consideration: Clear visuals that work on small screens


COLOR PALETTE
-------------

(TBD - To be defined in Visual Design Document)

Considerations:
- Must work for both dark and bright zones
- High contrast for mobile readability
- Distinct visual identity


TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
======================

PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------

Mobile (Primary):
- Touch controls (scheme TBD)
- Performance target: 60 FPS on mid-range devices
- Screen sizes: Phone and tablet support
- Portrait or landscape: TBD

PC (Secondary):
- Keyboard + mouse or gamepad
- Higher resolution support
- Performance target: 60+ FPS


GODOT 4.5 CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------

- 2D rendering pipeline
- Physics system for gravity manipulation
- Mobile export templates
- Input handling for touch + keyboard/gamepad

2. Create visual design document with references (Task 6)
3. Answer remaining open questions
4. Create technical architecture plan
5. Begin prototype implementation (separate plan)


NOTES
=====

Modular Design Approach:
- All systems designed to be modular and testable
- Gravity mechanics can be toggled independently
- Allows for rapid iteration and experimentation
- Supports A/B testing different mechanics

Design Philosophy:
- Start simple, expand if successful
- Prototype should prove core mechanics are fun
- Mobile-first but not mobile-limited
- Quality over quantity (1 great world > 3 mediocre worlds)
