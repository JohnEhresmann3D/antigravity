KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
====================

CORE MECHANICS
--------------

Gravity System (Modular):
- Gravity Flip: Unlocked after first boss, allows ceiling walking
- Directional Gravity Control: Player controls gravity direction
- Zero-Gravity Zones: Specific areas with no gravity
- Gravity Strength: Toggleable for experimentation (not zone-based)

Resource System:
- Single resource type (name TBD)
- Acquired from breakable objects (primary) and enemy drops (secondary)
- Used to power abilities

Ability System:
- Permanent abilities: Unlocked by defeating bosses, require resources
- Temporary powerups: Limited duration, found in world
- Boss defeats are primary unlock mechanism


VISUAL DESIGN
-------------

Dynamic Tone:
- Upbeat zones: Bright, colorful, satirical (Mario-inspired)
- Dark zones: Moody, atmospheric (Hollow Knight-inspired)
- Tone variety creates emotional journey

Art Style:
- Balance between Hollow Knight (detailed, atmospheric) and Mario (readable, clear)
- Mobile-first readability
- High contrast for small screens


TECHNICAL APPROACH
------------------

Platforms:
- Primary: Mobile (Android/iOS)
- Secondary: PC (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- Target: 60 FPS on mid-range mobile devices

Architecture:
- Modular systems (gravity, abilities, resources)
- Godot 4.5 with Forward Plus renderer
- Cross-platform input handling


PROTOTYPE SCOPE
---------------

1 World Focus:
- Single complete world with multiple interconnected areas
- At least 1 boss fight (unlocks gravity flip)
- Multiple zone types (bright and dark)
- Core mechanics implemented

Expand to 2 worlds only if prototype is successful


REMAINING OPEN QUESTIONS
========================

These questions should be answered before or during implementation:

1. Mobile Control Scheme
   - Virtual joystick, gesture-based, or touch zones?
   - How to handle gravity direction control on touch?

2. Resource Details
   - Resource name/theme?
   - Maximum capacity?
   - Exact drop rates?

3. Player Character Design
   - Character concept/theme?
   - Movement parameters (speed, jump height)?

4. Boss Design
   - Boss theme and mechanics?
   - Difficulty level?

5. World Theme
   - Specific world setting/theme?
   - Environmental hazards?
   - Enemy types?

6. Directional Gravity Control Implementation
   - 4-way, 8-way, or analog?
   - How does it interact with gravity flip?

7. Screen Orientation (Mobile)
   - Portrait or landscape?


NEXT STEPS
==========

Design Phase (Complete):
- [x] Create product specification
- [x] Answer core mechanics questions
- [x] Create Game Design Document
- [x] Create Visual Design Document
- [x] Create Technical Requirements Document

Ready for Implementation Phase:
- [ ] Answer remaining open questions (can be done during implementation)
- [ ] Create implementation plan (Engineer role)
- [ ] Set up Godot project structure
- [ ] Implement core systems
- [ ] Build prototype level
- [ ] Test on mobile devices


DESIGN ARTIFACTS LOCATION
==========================

All design documents are stored following Atlas framework structure:

Authoritative Documents:
- docs/specs/SPEC-2026-01-06-001-DESIGN.txt

Evidence/Reference Documents:
- artifacts/docs/GDD-2026-01-06-001.txt
- artifacts/docs/VDD-2026-01-06-001.txt
- artifacts/docs/TRD-2026-01-06-001.txt
- artifacts/docs/SUMMARY-2026-01-06-001.txt (this document)

Planning Documents:
- artifacts/pm/PLAN-2026-01-06-001-DESIGN-DOC.txt


DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
=================

The design follows these core principles:

1. Modular Approach
   - All systems can be toggled independently
   - Supports rapid iteration and experimentation
   - Easy to test individual mechanics

2. Mobile-First
   - Performance targets based on mobile constraints
   - Controls designed for touch
   - Readability on small screens

3. Prototype Focus
   - Prove core mechanics are fun
   - 1 world, expandable to 2
   - Quality over quantity

4. Tonal Variety
   - Dynamic visual tone creates emotional journey
   - Satirical upbeat vs. genuine moody
   - Keeps gameplay fresh

5. Metroidvania Progression
   - Abilities unlock through boss defeats
   - Backtracking with new abilities
   - Exploration and discovery


CONCLUSION
==========

Design documentation is complete and ready for implementation.

The design establishes:
- Clear game concept (2D platformer/Metroidvania)
- Core mechanics (modular gravity system)
- Visual direction (dynamic tone, mobile-first)
- Technical architecture (Godot 4.5, cross-platform)
- Prototype scope (1 world, core mechanics)

Remaining open questions can be answered during implementation or through
iterative prototyping.

Next phase: Create implementation plan and begin prototype development.
