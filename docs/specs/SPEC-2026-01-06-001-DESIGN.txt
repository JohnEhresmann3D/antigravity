PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------

The Antigravity Godot project is in its initial state with only basic project
configuration. Before implementing gameplay mechanics or features, we need to
establish the design foundation including:

- Visual design direction and art style
- Game concept and core mechanics
- User interface/UX approach
- Technical architecture patterns

Without clear design direction, development risks building features that don't
align with the intended vision or require significant rework later.


GOALS
-----

1. Define the visual design direction and art style for the Antigravity game
2. Establish core game concept and mechanics
3. Identify key design constraints and technical requirements
4. Create a design foundation that guides subsequent development


NON-GOALS
---------

1. Full implementation of game features (that comes after design)
2. Final asset creation (focus on direction, not production)
3. Complete technical architecture (high-level patterns only)


FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

MUST:
- Define what "Antigravity" means in the context of this game
- Establish visual style (2D/3D, art direction, color palette)
- Identify core gameplay loop
- Define target platform(s) and technical constraints

SHOULD:
- Create mood board or visual references
- Outline key game mechanics
- Identify UI/UX requirements
- Consider accessibility requirements

MAY:
- Create concept sketches or mockups
- Define audio/music direction
- Outline narrative or theme


CONSTRAINTS
-----------

- Godot 4.5 engine (Forward Plus renderer)
- Project name: "Antigravity"
- Current project is blank slate (no existing code to preserve)
- Target platforms: Mobile (primary) with PC support
- Scope: Prototype


SUCCESS CRITERIA
----------------

1. Clear written description of game concept exists
2. Visual design direction is documented with references
3. Core mechanics are identified and described
4. Technical constraints are documented
5. Design artifacts are stored in appropriate locations per Atlas framework


ASSUMPTIONS
-----------

- User has a vision for what "Antigravity" should be (CONFIRMED)
- Design work will precede implementation
- Atlas framework will be used for all subsequent work
- Mobile-first design with PC as secondary platform


DESIGN DIRECTION (ANSWERED)
----------------------------

GAME CONCEPT:
- Genre: 2D Platformer meets Metroidvania
- Core Inspiration: Super Mario Bros (platforming) + Hollow Knight (exploration, atmosphere)
- Theme: Antigravity mechanics as core gameplay element

VISUAL STYLE:
- 2D game
- Visual inspiration: Hollow Knight (atmospheric, detailed) + Super Mario (readable, colorful)
- Art direction: Balance between Hollow Knight's moody aesthetic and Mario's clarity

TARGET PLATFORMS:
- Primary: Mobile
- Secondary: PC
- Scope: Prototype

CORE MECHANICS:
- World selection system (multiple worlds)
- Progressive difficulty (increases over time)
- Powerup/Ability system:
  * Abilities unlock throughout game
  * Resource-based ability usage
  * Two types of abilities:
    - Permanent unlockable abilities (tied to resource)
    - Limited-time powerups (temporary boosts)
- Antigravity as primary mechanic (specific implementation TBD)

GAMEPLAY LOOP:
- Player selects world
- Navigate platforming challenges using antigravity mechanics
- Collect resources and powerups
- Unlock new abilities
- Progress through increasingly difficult content
- Metroidvania-style exploration and backtracking with new abilities


OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------

1. How exactly does the antigravity mechanic work?
   - Gravity flip (ceiling/floor)?
   - Gravity direction control?
   - Zero-gravity zones?
   - Variable gravity strength?

2. What is the resource system for abilities?
   - Single resource type or multiple?
   - How is it collected?
   - Regenerating or consumable?

3. Mobile controls approach?
   - Virtual joystick?
   - Gesture-based?
   - Touch zones?

4. World structure?
   - Linear progression or open selection?
   - How many worlds in prototype?
   - World themes?

5. Progression system?
   - How are abilities unlocked? (collectibles, boss defeats, exploration)
   - Save system requirements?

6. Visual tone balance?
   - More Hollow Knight (dark, atmospheric) or Mario (bright, cheerful)?
   - Color palette preferences?


DEPENDENCIES
------------

- User input on remaining design questions (above)
- Atlas framework setup (COMPLETE)


RISKS
-----

- Scope creep: Metroidvania games are complex; prototype must be carefully scoped
- Mobile controls: Platformers on mobile can be challenging; control scheme critical
- Performance: Mobile platform may constrain visual complexity
- Gravity mechanics: Complex gravity systems can be difficult to implement and tune


NOTES
-----

This spec establishes the high-level design direction. Next steps:
1. Answer remaining open questions
2. Create detailed design document
3. Define prototype scope (which features for initial version)
4. Plan technical architecture for mobile + PC deployment


DEPENDENCIES
------------

- User input on design vision and direction
- Atlas framework setup (COMPLETE)


RISKS
-----

- Scope creep: Design phase could expand indefinitely without clear boundaries
- Misalignment: Design direction may not match user's vision if questions aren't answered
- Technical feasibility: Design ideas may exceed Godot 4.5 capabilities


NOTES
-----

This spec is intentionally focused on gathering design requirements rather than
implementing features. The PM role will use this to create a task plan for
documenting the design direction.

Once design direction is established, subsequent specs will address implementation.
